      Hello, World! I'm Hans, and I'm a new student at <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus!</a> After spending many years working as a letter
      carrier for the United States Postal Service, I decided it was time for a carreer change. However, I had to address the fact
      that I was without the requisite skills to gain the quality of employment I desire. Enter: Epicodus. A place where I can learn and develop the 
      skills necessary to bring me into the exciting world of coding and programming. I look forward to sharing my adventure with you all.
    </p>

      The intent of this page is to serve as my <strong>first independant assignment</strong> for Epicodus.
      However, as time passes and more work is done, it will blossom into a far more full portfolio,
      which will display not only how I have progressed as a coder, but to show what I am capable of.

    <h3>Some of the Projects I've already worked on</h3>
    <p>I've had a small amount of practice over these last weeks
      <ul>Most of them are learning experiments
        <li><a href="https://github.com/hajschroeder/MonPrac.git">Cupcakes!</a> This was a website for an imaginary cupcake shop</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/hajschroeder/gitprac.git">My Practice Page!</a> This is a place where I am trying out new skills that I learn in class and do some independant practice.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/hajschroeder/Another-test-repo.git">A Test Repository.</a> I was having difficulty understand how to use Git Hub and Git Bash, so this was a repository I had made of previously existing files in order to get more practice on how to use them.</li>
      </ul>
