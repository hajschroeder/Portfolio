      Hello, World! I'm Hans, and I'm a new student at <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus!</a> After spending many years working as a letter
      carrier for the United States Postal Service, I decided it was time for a carreer change. However, I had to address the fact
      that I was without the requisite skills to gain the quality of employment I desire. Enter: Epicodus. A place where I can learn and develop the 
      skills necessary to bring me into the exciting world of coding and programming. I look forward to sharing my adventure with you all.

      The intent of this page is to serve as my <strong>first independant assignment</strong> for Epicodus.
      However, as time passes and more work is done, it will blossom into a far more full portfolio,
      which will display not only how I have progressed as a coder, but to show what I am capable of.

    <h2>Some Things About Me</h2>
    <div class="about">
      <p>As previously mentioned, I spent five years working as a letter carrier for the postal service (a job some folks might know better as <span class="highlight">"mail man"</span>). I resigned from that position in order to find work that better fit my new schedule, providing me with enough time to get in the practice I need to become a good coder. That new job was at New Seasons Market here in Portland, Oregon. But I've worked many different jobs.
        <div class="list">
          <ol><span class="whynot">Jobs I've had in order of how long I worked there</span>
            <li>Buyer and supervisor at a record store</li>
            <li>Letter carrier for the USPS</li>
            <li>Bicycle mechanic</li>
            <li>Grocery store clerk</li>
          </ol>

    <h3>Some of the Projects I've already worked on</h3>
      <div class="list">
        <ul><span class="whynot">Most of them are learning experiments</span>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/hajschroeder/MonPrac.git">Cupcakes!</a> This was a website for an imaginary cupcake shop</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/hajschroeder/gitprac.git">My Practice Page!</a> This is a place where I am trying out new skills that I learn in class and do some independant practice.</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/hajschroeder/Another-test-repo.git">A Test Repository.</a> I was having difficulty understanding how to use Git Hub and Git Bash, so this was a repository I had made of previously existing files in order to get more practice on how to use them.</li>
        </ul>
